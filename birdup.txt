 It was weird because he said he couldn't be seen, but how could he not be seen?
He goes, just do whatever you want 'cause I'm not seen, but, obviously, he is seen.
 Fundamentally, basically, as  segment, it's basically this.
The idea of him saying that he couldn't be seen was that as far as when the segment is completed, post-editing and stuff, essentially, they're probably going to add on other graphics and stuff or make him invisible -- whichever.
 But don't you think that was the finished product?
Why would they show us something that isn't the finished product?
 Focus group?
Give me a goddamn break.
They should focus on their own assholes.
